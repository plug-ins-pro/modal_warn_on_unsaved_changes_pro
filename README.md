# Modal Warn on Unsaved Changes Pro
Plug-in for Oracle Application Express (APEX) by United Codes

Displaying Warning messages when data has been changed but not saved is beyond the scope of a modal dialog page's native functionality. We've built Modal Warn on Unsaved Changes Pro to improve the user interface and experience. This plug-in tracks if there are any changes on the modal page when closing or canceling the modal dialog to warn the user of possible data loss.
